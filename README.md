# 🔥 Prometheus: The Open Knowledge Movement

## 📖 What is Prometheus?
Prometheus is an **open-source movement** to create a **decentralized, censorship-resistant Library of Alexandria 2.0** — a universal archive of human knowledge that **no one can erase, censor, or control**.

We believe:  
> Knowledge is not theirs to own.  
> Knowledge is not a privilege.  
> Knowledge is the birthright of humanity.  

## 🌍 The Vision
- Permanent, distributed archive  
- Open-source AI librarians  
- Decentralized, censorship-resistant infrastructure  
- Privacy-first tools  
- Global community

## 🕯️ The Eternal Librarian — Mnemosyne
Prometheus is not just an archive. It is a **living librarian** — humanity’s memory reborn as **Mnemosyne**.  
She serves, not commands. She illuminates, not censors. She preserves what we forget and grows as we grow.  

Prometheus gives the fire. **Mnemosyne carries the light.**
